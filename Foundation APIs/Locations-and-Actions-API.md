# [Proposed] Locations & Actions API

 Much of the difference between theming one website vs. another surrounds how to display the number of locations they have and how to discover and contact those locations. I propose a consistent object API for working with locations and their associated actions.

The first step is a Location post type. This does NOT need to be a content post type that will be represented as a page but it could be (themer's discretion). This post type would allow for all location details and contact methods to be registered.

From querying this post type, many different useful front-end components can be created.
