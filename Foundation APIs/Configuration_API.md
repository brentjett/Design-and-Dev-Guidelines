# [PROPOSED] Configuration API
The configuration API offers a fast, robust way to configure WordPress themes. By creating a single JSON file with configuration elements, a theme's functionality is easily discoverable later. Having a configuration data stored as JSON also has the benefit of being easily written to, so adding configuration details from a UI becomes much simpler.

API Reference to come. For now see https://github.com/brentjett/wp-theme-configuration
